1.You should find, unsurprisingly, that the clusters found correspond very well to the two major political parties (Democrats and
Republicans). What percentage of congresspeople does your model appear to "correctly" classify? (Hint: You will need to write
some additional code to compute the answer.)
	I wrote a function to calculate the number of correct data of republicans/democrats compared to the total and came to the conclusion:
		Number of correctly classified Republicans: 234
		Number of total Republicans: 242
		Percent of correctly classified Republicans to total Republicans: 96.69421487603306%

		Number of correctly classified Democrats: 194
		Number of total Democrats: 194
		Percent of correctly classified Democrats to total Democrats: 100.0%

		Percentage of correctly classified congresspeople to total congresspeople: 98.1651376146789%


2. Look at the cases where the congresspeople were misclassified. What went wrong? How could our clustering be improved?
	The congresspeople that were misclassified are IDs: 69, 82, 191, 195, 276, 361, 376, 435.
	Looking at the cluster values, ~60% of Democrat votes are 0, while only ~20% of Republicans votes are 0. Therefore, when our to_numerical function is converting all "Not Voting", it is siding with the Democrats when it should be neutral.
	To fix our clustering, I will adjust the to_numerical function to '1' if 'Yes' or 'Aye', '0' if 'No', 'Nay' and '0.5' if 'Not Voting' or 'Present'

3. You may have noticed that some votes were split by cluster, where as others were not. On what percentage of votes did the
"median" voter in each cluster differ? Based on the description of the votes provided by GovTrack, on what types of votes did
each party vote the same? On which types of votes did they differ?
	-The "median" voter in each cluster differ in 64.4% of votes.
	-It seems like the votes where, if passed, will benefit both parties, the votes are usually one-sided. Both parties vote the same. For example, human rights, empowering students, hospitals.
	-The votes that differs are the one where it would benefit one party over the other. For example,
